# Karel_Chess-Board-Challenge

## What is Karel?
#### <i> Karel is a very simple robot living in a very simple world. By giving Karel a set of commands, you can direct it to perform certain tasks within its world
#### <ii> The process of specifying those commands is called programming. Initially, Karel understands only a very small number of predefined commands, but an important part of the programming process is teaching Karel new commands that extend its capabilities.
#### <iii> Karel programs have much the same structure and involve the same fundamental elements as Python, a major programming language. The critical difference is that Karel’s programming language is extremely small and as such the details are easy to master.
